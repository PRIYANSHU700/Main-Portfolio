  bio: "Passionate full stack developer with expertise in creating beautiful, functional, and user-friendly web applications. I love turning complex problems into simple, intuitive designs.",
  longBio: `I'm a full stack developer with over a year of experience building modern web applications. My journey in web development started when I built my first website at the age of 18, and I've been hooked ever since.

  I did my training related to application development at ThinkNext Technologies. Apart from that have been part of the Training & Placement Cell and headed various company placements at our college

I specialize in React.js, Next.js and have worked with various frameworks and libraries to deliver robust solutions. I believe in clean code, responsive design, and accessibility.

When I'm not coding, you can find me doing Workout, Gaming , or experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen. I'm always eager to learn new technologies and techniques to improve my craft.`,
